# day-night-house

I made a scene with a two-story house and trees. By clicking the mouse to adjust the zone of time, the audience may see the visual of it in Day and Night. 

In this work, I've learned to use pseudocode and flowchart to plan my codes before getting right into them. They are simpler techniques for aiding in the process of generating all possible code concepts and clearly and directly visualising the flow.

I've learned how to write with point coordinates in shapes and how to swap between colours for Processing. Calculating and visualising the exact coordinates for the positions of the forms was a little challenging at first, but as I continued to practise, I became more accustomed to it. I've come to understand the significance of code sequence, which affects how elements overlap, in order to provide my visual depth. Research has been done to develop the function of producing a star and the animation required to make it rotate on its own in order to generate the shape of stars for Night Mode. In my situation, the mouse press and release is what makes a difference. It is interesting to be able to produce the work with audience engagement. I've also challenged myself to shift the house's shadow in the opposite direction from the sun's or moon's motion, which is controlled by the user's cursor. 

Overall, doing the work was enjoyable and I learned a lot.
